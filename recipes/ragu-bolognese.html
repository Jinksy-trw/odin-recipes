    <p><h4>This North Italian recipe comes from Bologna, Italy. One unusual characteristic of this Bolognese sauce is that it has no garlic — but there is a hint of ground nutmeg instead.</h4></p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons of butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup of diced onion</li>
        <li>1 cup of chopped carrot</li>
        <li>½ cup of chopped celery</li>
        <li>4 ounces of pancetta, diced (alternative can be bacon)</li>
        <li>12 ounces of lean ground pork</li>
        <li>¼ pound of lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cups of beef stock</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ pound of chicken liver</li>
        <li>1 cup of heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>½  teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch of ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Each in separate bowls.</li>
       <li>In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta; cook, stirring often, until lightly brown. Transfer to a heavy large saucepan once cooked to lightly brown color.</li>
       <li>In the same skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Cook and stir ground pork and beef in hot oil until crumbly and browned. Pour in wine, increase heat to medium-high, and boil briskly, stirring constantly,
            <br> until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Transfer ground meat mixture to the saucepan with pancetta and vegetables. Set the skillet aside.</li>
        <li>Stir beef stock and tomato paste into the saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté chicken livers in hot butter until firm and lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
            <br> Remove livers from the skillet and dice. Set aside and add to sauce 10 minutes before it is done.</li>
        <li>A few minutes before serving, stir in cream and cook until sauce is heated through. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. And now you can serve the meal. Good Appetite!</li>
